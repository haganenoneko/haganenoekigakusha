Today, I had the great fortune of attending LINA (Liu Institute Network for Africa) @ UBC's first seminar on how African countries are responding to COVID-19. As someone who doesn't have much background with African society/culture/current events, the seminar was very interesting. 

The speakers were:
1. [Dr. Thierry Nyatanyi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nyatanyi-thierry-369180110)
   Senior Advisor, COVID-19 Taskforce, Ministry of Health, Rwanda
2. [Dr. Salim S. Abdool Karim, FRS](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/ssa16)
   Director of the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA),
   Professor of Global Health, Columbia University,
   Chair of the South African Ministerial Advisory Committee for COVID-19, South Africa.
3. Minister Dr. Lemogang Kwape
   Ministry of Health and Wellness, Botswana
4. [Dr. Matshediso Moeti](https://www.afro.who.int/regional-director/biography)
   World Health Organization (WHO), Africa Regional Director

**1. Rwanda**
What I found particularly interesting from Dr. Nyatanyi's presentation was the types of data he presented, as I'm still unfamiliar with epidemiology/public health data as a whole. Overall, it seems that Rwanda has managed to keep the pandemic under control. Amazingly, the country was put under lockdown after merely *a week* after the first case was reported, as they duly noted the severity of the pandemic evidenced in Italy and China. They were able to increase testing capacity and slowly began re-opening procedures as the rate of new cases dropped. As expected, there were large increases in new cases after re-opening/more recently. Dr. Nyatanyi mentioned that these were expected and could be attributed to sources such as detention centers and other densely populated areas. 

**2. South Africa**
The South African response seemed developed, but unfortunately the increase in cases seems to be following an exponential. Dr. Karim mentions that, while they were able to leverage existing laboratory testing infrastructure for other infectious diseases, namely HIV and ebola, they were unable to procure sufficient numbers of testing kits due to global supply shortages. Nonetheless, the crux of the problem, he described, was a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" scenario regarding lockdown vs. re-opening: on one hand, quarantine prevents the spread of disease and helps mitigate the worst of the pandemic, but a national lockdown is economically unsustainable at both societal and individual levels. When people become unable to sustain their own livelihoods, the pandemic becomes less of a concern. So, despite brandishing impressive testing capacity, strategy, and human resources, South Africa seems have resolutely chosen to co-exist with the virus, even though it was never truly brought under control. 

**3. Botswana**
As a landlocked country, 80% of Botswana's goods are imported. Due to travel restrictions, many important goods are therefore in short supply. Therefore, the pandemic seems to have ignited a need for national R&D investment to develop testing capacity, equipment, etc. An absolute ban on travel was therefore impractical, and cases continue to be imported through truck drivers. 

**4. WHO**
As a broad overview of the African response, many of the key insights were nicely summarized in Dr. Moeti's presentation. One of sociological aspects that I haven't yet mentioned is that there's an important role for, and effect on, African women in particular during this pandemic. First, it seems that all the female-led countries in Africa have done very well in controlling the pandemic. Second, more women tend to work in healthcare than men, creating a disproportionate burden on women. However, there is also an increase in gender-based violence. Dr. Kwape mentioned, if I recall correctly, that while alcohol/tobacco were not sold in Botswana, they saw an increase in withdrawal and other addiction-related problems arise in the population. So, there are a lot of important sociological factors to consider when designing public health policies.
